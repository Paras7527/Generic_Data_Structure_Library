# ðŸ“‚ Generalized Data Structure Library Documentation

## Project Overview

### Technology: C++ Programming

This project is a comprehensive library designed to provide generic implementations of various data structures. It facilitates ready-made solutions for fundamental and advanced operations on both linear and non-linear data structures in an object-oriented manner. By leveraging generic programming, the library ensures compatibility with any data type, making it versatile and reusable across different applications.

The project adheres to object-oriented design principles, ensuring modularity, encapsulation, and extensibility.

## Key Features

1. **Generic Implementations**
   - Supports various data types through the use of templates.
   - Provides flexibility to apply the same implementation for multiple data types without modification.

2. **Linear Data Structures**
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Linear, Circular)
   - Stacks
   - Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)
     
3. **Fundamental Operations**
   - Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, and Searching for all supported structures.

4. **Reusable and Modular**
   - Each data structure and its operations are encapsulated in classes.
   - Modules can be independently maintained or extended.

## Installation Guide

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, or any standard C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later).
   - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks (optional).

2. **Steps to Install:**
   - Clone or download the repository.
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE or set up the files in your working directory.
   - Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example:
     ```bash
     g++ -o main main.cpp -std=c++11
     ```
     
3. **Usage:**
   - Include the desired header file(s) from the library in your project.
   - Create objects of the data structures and invoke operations as required.
